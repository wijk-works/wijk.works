Founded in 2020, Wijk Works was born from the desire to build, learn and change things. Steve Jobs put it very eloquently:

---

> _When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life._
>
> _Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact - and that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it. You can influence it. You can build your own things that other people can use._
>
> _To shake off this erroneous notion that life is there, and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it. Change it, improve it. Make your mark upon it. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again._

### The Name

Figuring out a great _and_ unique name is hard! Especially if you want a shorter one and the `.com` domain.
I (Dan van Wijk) tried a few but soon felt I needed to find a different strategy. For these kind of things my imagination is a bit limited. I started looking at the long list of available top-level domains. Going back and forth a few times and one that got my attention was `.works`.

It works (pun intended) on many levels and looks good when combined with my last name Wijk, as they both start with _W_. So there you have it - `wijk.works` was available and I found no other company with a similar name. Wijk Works AB was born.

### The Logo

Guidelines were to keep it simple, minimal yet not too boring. Easy enough.

Browsing Google Fonts for a nice font, pair that with a good, distinct color and voil√°. Still something missing though.. let's add an underscore for that extra touch of distinctiveness, a bit of geekiness and mysteriousness - indicating _things to come..._
